# Face-Detection-with-OpenCV
Train a face detector with your own photos and detect yourself from a camera.

## Usage:
1. Put your headshots in the images/YOURNAME directory.
2. Python faces-train.py
3. Python faces.py
## Here you go!  



## Results:

### I train the detector with only 14 of my headshots and it can readily detect my face.

### But the detector detects my eyes with difficulty. It omits one sometimes.

### It functions perfectly after removing glasses.
